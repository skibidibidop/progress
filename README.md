Hi!

This is my website, and I'll record my learning journey here.

It will change wildly as I learn more about Web Development.

Right now, I barely know any HTML, CSS, and JS, but I thought I should get some practice by making my own website.

I don't expect to run out of things to learn and projects to do, so this website will stay updated until I die or become senile. :)
